    <h3 class="line-i">About Myself</h3>
    <p class="first">I’m Monika Khaling Rai, a certified beauty professional based in Urlabari, Nepal, with over four years of experience in the beauty and wellness industry. I specialize in nail artistry, pedicure, and professional makeup, offering clients both classic and contemporary looks tailored to their personal style and preferences. With a strong foundation in certified cosmetology training and hands-on experience from two of Nepal’s well-regarded salons, I bring both technical precision and creative expression to every service I provide.</p>

    <p class="sec">My clients describe my work as thoughtfully artistic, hygienic, and exceptionally detail-oriented. Whether it's a custom nail design, a rejuvenating pedicure, or a flawless bridal makeup look, I strive to deliver results that not only enhance appearance but also uplift confidence. I take great pride in creating a welcoming, respectful, and relaxing environment, where each client feels heard and valued.</p>
    
    <p class="thir">I firmly believe that beauty is not a luxury—it’s a right, and my mission is to empower others by helping them express their inner and outer beauty with grace. I currently offer services from my professional studio, ensuring the highest standards of cleanliness and quality. While I have collaborated with top-tier salons and participated in various notable projects, I remain focused on building personal, long-term client relationships rooted in trust and excellence.</p>

    <p class="last">If you're looking for someone who blends artistry, expertise, and empathy into every service, I would be honored to be part of your beauty journey.
